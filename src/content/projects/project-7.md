## Summary

- Compared Genotype by Sequencing data from different restriction enzymes to _Cucurbita pepo_ transcript sequences using [BLAST](https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi)

- Developed and tested [KASP markers](https://www.protocols.io/view/kasp-genotyping-kqdg39qr7g25/v1) for relevant genes in peppers to make available for breeding work

- Extracted DNA and utilized PCR and DNA sequencing to determine whether a mutation in a predicted gene was responsible for the observed phenotype in peppers.
