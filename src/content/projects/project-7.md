**Figure**. Casual mutation in disease resistance genes using KASP_*pvr1* and KASP_*Bs3* markers in peppers(Holdsworth & Mazourek 2015)

## Summary:

* Compared Genotype by Sequencing data from different restriction enzymes to *Cucurbita pepo* transcript sequences using [BLAST](https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi)

* Developed and tested [KASP markers](https://www.protocols.io/view/kasp-genotyping-kqdg39qr7g25/v1) for relevant genes in peppers to make available for breeding work

* Extracted DNA and utilized PCR and DNA sequencing to determine whether a mutation in a predicted gene was responsible for the observed phenotype in peppers.
