  caption: '<strong>Figure.</strong> <em>Inherited threshold model of disease</em>. This chart illustrates how common genetic modifiers influence the penetrance of rare monogenic diseases. The left bar shows complete penetrance: all carriers of a rare pathogenic variant (blue) are affected. The other bars represent variable penetrance, as seen in conditions like cardiomyopathies.'

## Summary:

- Organized genetic and medical data leveraged from self-reports, electronic health records, and ~500K exomes in the [UK biobank](https://www.ukbiobank.ac.uk/) and generated version-controlled code with [git](https://git-scm.com/) to ensure reproducibility

- Leveraged latest update of [UK biobank](https://www.ukbiobank.ac.uk/) to identify a sufficiently sized cohort of known and novel cardiomyopathy variant carriers to improve upon previous studies without adequate statistical power

- Calculated [PRS](https://www.genome.gov/Health/Genomics-and-Medicine/Polygenic-risk-scores) from relevant GWAS and evaluated logistic, cox, and linear regression to quantify the association of common variants on disease penetrance, onset, and severity among the rare pathogenic variant carriers and use the results to provide
  genetic insight for decreasing disease outcomes

- Articulated technical genetic study in internal symposiums to showcase my work to multidisciplinary audiences including nonsubject
  matter experts (eg. biologists, leadership)
