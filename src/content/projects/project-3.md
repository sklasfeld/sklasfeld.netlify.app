  caption: 'From my graduate work on artifact detection in ChIP-seq and Cut & Run datasets, this IGV screenshot shows greenscreen and blacklist tracks (top), and bedgraph signals for IgG, H3, and H3K27me3 (bottom) from fixed and non-fixed Arabidopsis tissues (Zheng & Gehring, 2019). Ultrahigh peaks from mapped reads overlap with greenscreen regions, revealing shared artifacts across experiments(Klasfeld <i>et al</i> 2022).'

## Summary

- Developed [Greenscreen method](https://github.com/sklasfeld/GreenscreenProject) to accurately identify and mask false-positive ChIP-seq peaks with efficacy in _Arabidopsis_, _Drosophila_, and _Oryza sativa_ resulting in 1st author publication

- Designed and orchestrated Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) data analysis (eg. ChIP-Seq, RNA-seq, MNase-seq) to measure the activity and outcomes of mobile and DNA binding proteins functional in cellular reprogramming, resulting in three 2nd author publications

## Selected Awards

- Honorable Mention of the 2016 National Science Foundation (NSF) Graduate Research Fellowship
