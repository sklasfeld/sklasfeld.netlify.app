**Figure**. Cut & Run reads mapped to _Arabidopsis_ genome show that greenscreen regions identify regions of ultra-high artifacts in both ChIP-seq and Cut & Run sequencing experiments (Klasfeld _et al_ 2022).

## Summary:

- Developed [Greenscreen method](https://github.com/sklasfeld/GreenscreenProject) to accurately identify and mask false-positive ChIP-seq peaks with efficacy in _Arabidopsis_, _Drosophila_, and _Oryza sativa_ resulting in 1st author publication

- Designed and orchestrated Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) data analysis (eg. ChIP-Seq, RNA-seq, MNase-seq) to measure the activity and outcomes of mobile and DNA binding proteins functional in cellular reprogramming, resulting in three 2nd author publications
