## Summary

- Collaborated with computational biologists to analyze the genomes of Hydractinia echinata and Hydractinia symbiolongicarpus by designing and implementing analysis of novel small RNAs during head regeneration for publication
- Employed a domain architecture search strategy to identify TRAF immune genes in the genomes of multiple eukaryotes to explore _Cnidarian_ evolution
