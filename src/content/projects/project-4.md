**Figure**. An example of microRNA in *Rotylenchulus reniformis*, a parasitic nematode of plants, predicted using [mirDeep2](https://www.mdc-berlin.de/content/mirdeep2-documentation) and validated with [CentroidFold](http://rtools.cbrc.jp/centroidfold/) during my summer internship.

## Summary:

* Investigated novel microRNAs in *R. reniformis*

* Assessed [AHA](https://rhallpb.github.io/Applications/AHA.html) and [PBJelly](https://sourceforge.net/p/pb-jelly/wiki/Home/) as gap closing and scaffold tools for *Medicago truncatula*, a legume of scientific interest due to its symbiotic relationships with nitrogen-fixing bacteria and fungi, using PacBio sequencing data
