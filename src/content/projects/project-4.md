**Figure**. Illustration of the automated filtering process for identifying miRNAs in *Hydractinia*, marine organisms with the capacity to regenerate their entire body throughout their lifetime, which considers secondary structure and computational score given by [mirDeep2](https://www.mdc-berlin.de/content/mirdeep2-documentation) ([Schnitzler *et al* 2023](https://genome.cshlp.org/content/suppl/2024/04/15/gr.278382.123.DC1/Supplemental_Material.pdf))

## Summary:

* Collaborated with computational biologists to analyze the genomes of Hydractinia echinata and Hydractinia symbiolongicarpus by
designing and implementing analysis of novel small RNAs during head regeneration for publication

• Employed a domain architecture search strategy to identify TRAF immune genes in the genomes of multiple eukaryotes to explore
cnidarian evolution
