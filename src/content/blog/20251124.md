If I learned anything working with the UK Biobank Research Analysis Platform and All of Us Workbench, it's this: don't fear the iceberg. As researchers, we're trained to be skeptical. Every dataset comes with biases and baggage. The temptation is to dive straight in—find the clinical phenotypes, grab the genomic data, and start analyzing. But that approach ignores the complexity lurking beneath the surface.

The good news: this complexity isn't insurmountable. It just requires understanding the data first. With this post, I hope to demystify UK Biobank and All of Us so you can navigate them confidently, armed with knowledge of what to watch for.

## Phenotype Data

All of Us recommends starting with their Cohort and Dataset Builders, point-and-click tools designed to help researchers navigate the data. But as a bioinformatician, I was more comfortable diving into the code iteself. I skipped the builders and went straight to querying the [SQL tables](https://support.researchallofus.org/hc/en-us/articles/30125602539284-Introduction-to-All-of-Us-Electronic-Health-Record-EHR-Collection-and-Data-Transformation-Methods) directly. From there, I was greeted with the familiar face of messy phenotype data. Let me introduce you.
